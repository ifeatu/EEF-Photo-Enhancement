## 🔄 Before vs After Code Examples

### **Error Handling Transformation**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Basic error handling
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/photos');
  const data = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  alert('Something went wrong');
}

// AFTER: Professional error handling
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/photos');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  const data = await response.json();
  logger.info('Photos loaded successfully', { count: data.photos.length });
} catch (err) {
  logger.error('Failed to load photos', err, { url: '/api/photos' });
  showError('Load Error', 'Failed to load photos. Please try again.');
}
```

### **API Optimization**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Manual fetch with no optimization
const [photos, setPhotos] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

const fetchPhotos = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/photos');
    const data = await response.json();
    setPhotos(data.photos);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

// AFTER: Optimized with caching and error handling
const { data: photosData, loading, error, refetch } = useApi<{photos: Photo[]}>('/api/photos');
const photos = photosData?.photos || [];
```
