  loadImage(file: File): Promise<ImageData>
  applyFilters(image: ImageData, filters: FilterConfig[]): Promise<ImageData>
  exportImage(image: ImageData, format: 'jpeg' | 'png' | 'webp'): Promise<Blob>
}

// Filter configuration
interface FilterConfig {
  type: 'brightness' | 'contrast' | 'saturation' | 'sharpen' | 'denoise'
  intensity: number // 0-100
  parameters?: Record<string, any>
}
```
